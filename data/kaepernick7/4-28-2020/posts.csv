To touch those impacting lives in a real way and to make sure that those in need benefited from the dollars donated.¬†¬†While on the journey what I realized was the person that benefited the most from this pledge was myself. I've learned about and had the privilege to work with so many quality organizations fighting for Social Justice daily. I've met so many people that work with so many great non-profits that do amazing work. I've been humbled by the appreciation from places like Assata‚Äôs Daughters United We Dream and Standing Rock to name just a few of where my contributions from my pledge were able to help. The #MillionDollarPledge was never for me or about me - It has and always will continue to be for and about the people. Perhaps what I've learned most is that we can all enact change. Not everyone has to donate monetarily. Some organizations need volunteers and time just as much as they need a donation. Head over to Kaepernick7.com to learn more about all the programs that have been a part of my #10for10 as well as my #MillionDollarPledge.

In a press statement held the following day in Atlanta Mrs. Coretta Scott King welcomed the verdict saying  ‚ÄúThere is abundant evidence of a major high level conspiracy in the assassination of my husband Martin Luther King Jr. And the civil court‚Äôs unanimous verdict has validated our belief. I wholeheartedly applaud the verdict of the jury and I feel that justice has been well served in their deliberations. This verdict is not only a great victory for my family but also a great victory for America. It is a great victory for truth itself. It is important to know that this was a SWIFT verdict delivered after about an hour of jury deliberation.The jury was clearly convinced by the extensive evidence that was presented during the trial that in addition to Mr. Jowers the conspiracy of the Mafia local state and federal government agencies were deeply involved in the assassination of my husband. The jury also affirmed overwhelming evidence that identified someone else not James Earl Ray as the shooter and that Mr. Ray was set up to take the blame. I want to make it clear that my family has no interest in retribution. Instead our sole concern has been that the full truth of the assassination has been revealed and adjudicated in a court of law‚Ä¶ My husband once said ‚ÄúThe moral arc of the universe is long but it bends toward justice.‚Äù To-day almost 32 years after my husband and the father of my four children was assassinated I feel that the jury‚Äôs verdict clearly affirms this principle. With this faith we can begin the 21st century and the new millennium with a new spirit of hope and healing.‚Äù",1625,,"",25766
